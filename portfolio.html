    <h3>Blown to Bits Reflection </h3>
    <p>Computing will transform society, true or false? Ever since the boom of computers society has been truly everchanging. Computers have made society change for the better and worse. Computers have made communication as simple as a push of a button and have created a source where people can openly share ideas. Ways that computers maybe bad is the fact that nothing you look up or type is safe. The government can view everything you have ever said or done.  This can be good in the fact you know that ever the bad thing is monitored but this also means everything you do is monitored. Nothing can be published with parts hidden because everything that you do on a computer is irreversible unlike in the past where sensitive information could be blocked out and published. This changes society because everyone has to carefully watch their steps and no one is really anonymous anymore.</p>
    <h3>Lightbot Reflection</h3>
    <p>How is Lightbot like a computer? How is Lightbot different than a computer?
A computer is an electronic device that is used for storing and processing data. Lightbot resembles this because you follow a pattern and produce a code which the little robot processes and follows. Both things comprehend human code and produce what it is the human is trying to accomplish. A way that Lightbot is different from an actual computer because it is not as complex. It cannot process the same amount of data a computer can and it only has a minimal amount of actions it can accomplish. Although they are similar in the sense both need to be coded and contain pieces of code and loops they are also different based on the amount of things they are able to do.</p>

	 <h3>Scratch P.1 Conclusion</h3>
	 <p>1. It’s a good idea to write code in small pieces so you don’t make a little mistake in a huge amount of code; basically It saves time.</p>
	 <p>2. In math it is easy to make small mistakes and to have to restart several times on a problem. This is like coding because it’s easy to make such little mistakes that mess up everything in the long run. A way that is is different is that coding is mainly abbreviations and shortcuts while math could be you wrote the wrong number. </p>
	 <p>3. Dual-core computers make you feel like it’s running 10 more programs at once by the speed of it and the fact it is spread out on more than just one core and it improves the overall performance. </p>
