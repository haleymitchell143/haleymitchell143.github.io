    <h1>Blown to Bits Reflection </h1>
    <p>Computing will transform society, true or false? Ever since the boom of computers society has been truly everchanging. Computers have made society change for the better and worse. Computers have made communication as simple as a push of a button and have created a source where people can openly share ideas. Ways that computers maybe bad is the fact that nothing you look up or type is safe. The government can view everything you have ever said or done.  This can be good in the fact you know that ever the bad thing is monitored but this also means everything you do is monitored. Nothing can be published with parts hidden because everything that you do on a computer is irreversible unlike in the past where sensitive information could be blocked out and published. This changes society because everyone has to carefully watch their steps and no one is really anonymous anymore.</p>
